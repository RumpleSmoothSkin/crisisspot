            Welcome to &nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="crisislogo_transparent3.png" style="height: 25px; width:30 px;"> <br>
            This site is intended for mapping crises and incidents. <br>
            Right now <u>we are asking the Israeli public to help us map out the current heatwave fires *together*.</u>. <br>
            Instructions for using the site are below. Please note that this site is in <u>development</u> and we are working as fast as we can to make basic features available for everyone to use at this time.<br>
            <b>Instructions:</b><br>
            <u>Add a fire:</u> Zoom in on area. Click on the <img src="/images/fire_button.png"> marker on the left, then click on the map to place it. Repeat to add more.<br>
            <u>Removing a fire:</u> Click on the <img src="/images/fire_button.png"> on the map. A bubble will appear with the marker number. Click the "delete" button.<br> 
            Any marker can be deleted. please remove fires only if they are finished.
            <br><br>
            Do not be alarmed at other markers appearing suddenly - these are others mapping the fires in real-time!
